Adoree Jackson ran the anchor leg on USC’s 4×100 meter relay team that finished fourth at the NCAA track-and-field championships today. The Trojans’ time of 38.75 seconds was second-fastest in school history and .06 seconds off the school record set in 1980. BeeJay Lee, Andre De Grasse, Just’N Thymes and Jackson comprised the relay team.
UPDATED: DeGrasse wins the 100 meters in a wind-aided 9.75 seconds. He is the first USC sprinter to win the 100 since Clancy Edwards in 1978.
